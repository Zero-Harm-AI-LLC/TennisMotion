The idea is to start from a pretrained model and train it to recognize both existing classes and your new ones â€” without forgetting the old ones (i.e., no catastrophic forgetting). Retain existing YOLO classes (like person, car, dog) from pretrained weights and add new custom class tennis_ball.\n",
